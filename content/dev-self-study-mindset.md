lead with CRIPSY pain

you've decided you want to learn programming and get a job as a software developer
overwhelmed

what should I be doing?
learn tools?
learn computer science?
what entry level jobs can I get
can I jump straight into machine learning?

this is HOW to study not WHAT to study
I don't know what you should study
this isn't a roadmap or laundry lists
those lists are kind of arbitrary
i won't tell you exactly what to do (but it does contain some concrete advice)
tells you how to think

this is a collection of my thoughts, it's kind of long and sprawling
I've been sitting on this post for a few years
I might break it up into sub posts later

### follow your enthusiasm

- what exactly should I work on? what should I study?
- have a goal, BUT try get there by working on shit that interests you

- why would you want to grind this out?
- if you don't know what you like, you should be exploring different parts of software development

* your goal will change over time
* practice is the most important thing
* meta skills - how to debug, how to find info, how to read docs
* it's OK to give up half way, as long as you start something else
* it's normal to get stuck
* learning happens in cycles
* there's a lot to learn
* you are learning how to learn
* there are a lot of ways to be right
* it's hard to learn the wrong thing

### tools or concepts

- you need both
- concepts tell you how to use the tools, learn faster, how to debug
- you need tools, frameworks, to be productive: you do not want to invent the 2020 programmer's toolchain from scratch
- you cannot and will not learn all the concepts or all the tools up front, sample and cycle
- you will never understand security, but every time you will know a little more

### pace yourself

it's really hard to say how long it takes to get a software job from scratch
many variables (location), luck dependent
it'll probably take longer than you expect

how much study should I do?
this is what works for me.

- 4hrs a day
- 1-2h a day of study
- 2-10h a day of coding
- don't force yourself over your line
- if you find yourself struggling to do 4 hours, figure out how to make it more fun

### the most important thing

what is your employer's strategy? hiring the best developer?
no! they want to minimise risk of a bad hire
their business strategy doesn't look like this:

- come up with a business product that can only be implemented by a genius developer
- hire genius developer
- ???
- profit

they don't pin their hopes on you being a genius, they just need you to be good enough
this might seem like meaningless waffle to you: so what? where's the bar?
I believe this changes your strategy

- risk reduction == satisficing
- demonstrate skills
- pick a target stack and build something in that stack - it isn't necessarily the stack that you'll work with at work
  - you just showed them that you can pick up new tech and ship code
  - they're not stupid, they know you can do it again
  - prove that you can do it again
- show them you can actually make something work end-to-end
  - if you "Know React" but can't make things work, who cares?
  - if you have the meta skills of getting shit to work, learning React is a small investment
  - not knowing React is not a risk, it just means you require investment
  - I got my first few developer jobs having never used the primary languages or frameworks used at their work
  - didn't know C#
- solve new problems every day
- have something to show

- internships are good for this reason
- online courses are meh for this reason (content over credentiasl)
- degrees are okaaay for this reason
- not everyone thinks like me -> some people want to see degrees, credentials

* web development BUT follow your motivation and I don't know everything

### what jobs can I do?

you should have a target job
you'll need to have a goal to ship something specific

I feel the least confident in this section
really if you feel strongly about this then do your things
BUT do your homework - your homework is to find people who do this job and learn about what they do
and what they think of their job

web development
most software is delivered over the web with a JavaScript client and a backend server
your local insurance company has an online claims form, but they don't have any hardware or desktop apps
6? 8? programs on my desktop, one of them is a web browser
another is spotify
107 entries in my LastPass

there are a lot of jobs where you transition into them
devops or infrastructure is something you can transition into
same with security
same with data engineering
same with machine learning engineer

business analyst and QA (not recommended, but possible)
you will probably go back down to entry level

data science is not really sofware development
it's software development adjacent - whole new skill set and domain knowledge
I don't know anything about studying to get a data scientist job

games is a passion industry like being a musician (not confident)

I don't know anything about embedded development

### applying for jobs

when do I apply for jobs?
as soon as you've shipped a side project
applying for jobs is free
you can't apply for jobs full time, so best to do it on the side
job ads are garbage
use interviews to get feedback on what skills you need as you can

get people on the phone, task risks, try to get lucky
go to local coding meetups - there's nothing like watching a tired middle aged guy get up on stage and kind of awkwardly beg for
someone to apply to his job to give you a sense of perspective
learn that other developers are human

### free money

this is someone who I want to work with?
maybe I won't have to clean up after this person
learn the basic tools around your code

- everyone should know git
- write a helpful README (this was common in our code tests)
- write tests (point it out)
- take care of your code (linting, formatting)
- automate your tests and linting
- basic deployment
- double triple bonus: write a blog
