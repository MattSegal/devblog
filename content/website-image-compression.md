Often when you're creating a website, a client or designer will provide you with large images that are 2-5MB in size and thousands of pixels wide.
The large file size of these images will make them slow to load on your webpage, making it seem slow and broken

This video shows you a quick browser-only workflow for cropping, resizing and compressing these images so that they will load more quickly on a webpage.
It's not very advanced, but it doesn't need to be. Here I convert images from ~2MB to ~100kB, which is a ~20x reduction in file size.
